# Bot Project

This bot, [@DinosaurShouto1](https://twitter.com/DinosaurShouto1), is a twitter bot that shouts out either Dinosaur names or facts about what foods different Dinosaurs ate.

At first I wanted to do a bot that shouted out movie quotes. I worked on that idea for a while but it was way to complicated to put the code together. My next idea was dinosaurs. Just because I like dinosaurs.

There are exactly 1,000,000 different dinosaur names or facts that it can tweet out.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
