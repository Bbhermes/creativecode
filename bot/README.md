# Bot Project

This bot, [@DinosaurShouto1](https://twitter.com/DinosaurShouto1), is a twitter bot that shouts out either Dinosaur names or facts about what foods different Dinosaurs ate.

At first I wanted to do a bot that shouted out movie quotes. I worked on that idea for a while but it was way to complicated to put the code together. My next step was to just do movie quotes from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. However while that was much easier it still was more work than I felt was really necessary for the project. Finally, I decided to just scrap the whole movie idea and switch to something else. My next idea was dinosaurs. Just because I like dinosaurs. I needed a way to create variations that the bot would spit out. I decided an easy way to seperate different dinosaurs was to split them up into categories based on what they ate. After that the bot was ready.

There are exactly 1,000,000 different dinosaur names or facts that it can tweet out.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
