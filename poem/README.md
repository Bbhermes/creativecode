# Dracula Poem

This project is a poem generator in Python. To see it run, download the [python script](Dracula.py) and run it with Python or in a notebook. It will require a program called Markovfy, so make sure you've installed that first. 

This script also assumes you have a file called "frankenstein.txt" in the same directory that the script runs from. The contents of that file can be anything you want to appropriate from. If you have different files, you can just change the filename reference on line 9 of the script.

What this script will do is read the input file, parse it for parts of speech, then output a stanza of something that hopefully resembles poetry. The poetic quality of that output will vary widely based on the input. 

Honestly (or should I say "frankly"? Get it?) I don't usually find the output of this script particularly compelling, but I think it's a good demonstration of some important concepts like working with a library and parts of speech tagging.
