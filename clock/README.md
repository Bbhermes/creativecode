Analouge Clock

This is an analogue clock I made with p5.js. The easiest way to see it in action is to copy the contents of MyClock into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org) and run it. Here is a link for it: https://editor.p5js.org/Bbhermes/present/W5prAgAwk

To read the clock's time, you have read the analogue clock hands that go around the face of the clock. The long red hand is seconds, the slightly shorter blue hand is minutes, and the shortest green hand is hours.

I git my inspiration for this clock from the coding train youtube channel run by Daniel Shiffman. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=322&v=E4RyStef-gY) I watched his coding challenge number 74 video where he made a clock and followed along with his instructions to create my own. However his clock was very basic as it was just the hands moving and I wanted to make it better. To do this I created a clock face out of ellipses and clock points for 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock. In addition I didn't like how his clock's hour and minute hands moved when the second hand caused each of them to move so I edited them slightly for the movement to be smoother.

I really like the way my clock moves because of the smoothness. It is very obvious just from looking at the clock what it is and what it's trying to do. I also really like how the colors stand out from each other and grab the viewers attention.
